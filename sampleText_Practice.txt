Exeter Cathedral is a beautiful example of Gothic architecture!! Construction on the cathedral began in 1114. It was rebuilt between 1270 and 1350 under six bishops. The Vault (Cathedral Ceiling) from east to west door is about 315 feet and a marvel to behold. It's the longest continuous medieval stone vault in the world. There is lots to see here. The rate for Seniors to vist the CATHEDrl () was £5 GBP. It is well worth the price :) There is a Minstrel's Gallery; the Martyrs Pulpit; & the Exeter Astronomical Clock which my husband found fascinating. The clock dates from 1484 with a smaller minute dial added in 1760. There is a hole cut into the door at the bottom of the clock. The purpose of the hole was so the    Bishop's cat would have access to all the mice and rats that got into the clock.Be sure to pick up a brochure so you know what you are looking at. We wére lucky enough to be there when the organist was practcing for an upcoming event. The music soared up to the vaulted ceiling. {{It was an amazng expernce!!/.@£$] There are lots of elaborate tombs around the cathedral &nbsp; burial vaults in the floor:: Exeter Cathedral is not to be misséd. Parkng is a little sketchy, so get there early in the day.
